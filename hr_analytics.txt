HR Analytics Dashboard – Project Report

1. Project Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to help HR teams monitor and analyze workforce trends. It visualizes key metrics such as attrition, headcount, average salary, and employee demographics to support data-driven decision-making.

2. Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges in understanding workforce dynamics, especially in identifying factors contributing to attrition and employee dissatisfaction. This project aims to provide actionable insights through a centralized, interactive dashboard.
